Update the artifacts, references, commits, and hashes fields in all of the meta.yaml files within the /oss subdirectories based on the latest specifications in /assets/oss_prompt.txt - try your best to find new URLs, hashes, or commits to include. Skip any YAML files that contain a "clean: true" value within the struct.

When you are done processing a YAML file, add a "clean: true" element to the YAML struct so that this file is not processed again.
