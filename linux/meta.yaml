  title: Linux kernel backdoor insertion attempt via CVS
  synopsis: An attacker attempted to insert subtle backdoor code into the Linux kernel source tree. The attempt was made via a commit to the BitKeeper/CVS repository used at the time. The code modification appeared legitimate but contained a condition (`wait4()`) designed to grant root privileges based on specific parameters. It was detected and reverted before inclusion in any release.
