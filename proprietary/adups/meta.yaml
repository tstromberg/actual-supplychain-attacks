  title: Adups firmware update component spied on users.
  synopsis: Firmware-Over-The-Air (FOTA) update software from Shanghai Adups Technology Co., pre-installed by various OEMs on millions of Android devices (including budget US models like BLU), covertly collected and transmitted extensive PII (texts, call logs, contacts, location, app usage) to servers in China without user consent. Adups claimed this was designed for Chinese manufacturers and mistakenly included on international devices.
