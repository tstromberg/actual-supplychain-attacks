  title: "@solana/web3.js NPM package compromised stealing private keys"
  synopsis: Attackers compromised an NPM publish-access account, reportedly via spear-phishing a maintainer. They published malicious versions (1.95.6, 1.95.7) of the widely used `@solana/web3.js` package to NPM. The injected code captured private keys handled by dependent applications (especially bots or backend systems) and exfiltrated them to an attacker's server (`sol-rpc.xyz`), enabling cryptocurrency theft estimated around $160k USD.
