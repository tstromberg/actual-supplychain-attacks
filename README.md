# oss-supplychain-attacks

Data about all known supply-chain attacks against open-source projects throughout history: from 2002 to 2025.

This only includes cases that attacked an open-source project or its official distribution mechanisms (such as an offical mirror).

We do not include attacks that involved random USB keys found on the sidewalk, typo-squatting, unauthorized distribution mechanisms, or other types of social engineering attacks.

## Pwn Count
