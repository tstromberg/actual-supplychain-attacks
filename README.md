# actual-supplychain-attacks

This repository contains comprehensive data about actual software supply-chain attacks throughout history.

This repository only includes cases where an open-source project or commercial product distributed compromised software knowingly or accidentally.

We do not include drive-by attacks that had no involvement with an open-source project or commercial product, such as:

- Random USB keys found on a sidewalk
- Typosquatting attacks
- Malware uploaded to random websites
- Social-engineering attacks that did not involve the project/product

## OSS Pwn Count

* 56 OSS projects
* 59 incidents

To the best of my knowledge, this data is complete, but if you know of any cases where a software supply-chain attack impacted a known open-source project, please open an issue.

## Proprietary Pwn Count

* 42 products & incidents

Note: Available data on commercial software supply-chain attacks is limited, as attacks on commercial tools often go unannounced. This number is almost certainly a severe undercount.
