# actual-supplychain-attacks

Data about all known supply-chain attacks against software projects throughout history.

This only includes cases that attacked a known product/project - or attacked its official distribution mechanisms (such as source code, offical mirror, container registry).

We do not include drive-by attacks that had no involvement with the official project, such as:

- Random USB keys found on a sidewalk
- Typosquatting attacks
- Malware uploaded to random websites unrelated to the project/product
- Social-engineering attacks that did not involve the project/product

## OSS Pwn Count

![OSS supply-chain compromises over time](_research/chart.png)

* 56 OSS projects
* 59 incidents

This should be within 5% of reality.

## Proprietary Pwn Count

* 42 products & incidents

NOTE: Data on commercial software supply-chain attacks is very limited. This number represents what is almost certainly a severe undercount.

## PR's welcome!

This project is very much a work in progress. The data is incomplete and often inaccurate. PR's welcome!
