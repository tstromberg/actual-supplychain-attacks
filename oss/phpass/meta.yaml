- name: phpass (Hautelook fork on GitHub / Packagist)
  title: hautelook/phpass library hijacked via GitHub org.
  synopsis: The GitHub organization 'hautelook', which maintained a popular fork of the phpass PHP password hashing library, was deleted. An attacker later registered the 'hautelook' organization name and created a repository named 'phpass' with the same URL as the original. This new repository contained a malicious version of phpass designed to steal AWS credentials by exfiltrating environment variables. Packagist, which mirrored the original GitHub repository, then began serving this malicious version to users who updated the dependency.
