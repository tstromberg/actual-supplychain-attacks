  title: Linux Mint website hack redirects ISO downloads
  synopsis: The Linux Mint website, specifically its WordPress installation, was compromised. Attackers modified download links on the site for the Linux Mint 17.3 Cinnamon edition ISO. These links redirected users to a server hosting a modified ISO containing the Tsunami backdoor, giving attackers remote control over infected machines.
