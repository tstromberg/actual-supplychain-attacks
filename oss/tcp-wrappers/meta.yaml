  title: tcp-wrappers distribution trojanized granting remote root
  synopsis: The official source code distribution tarball for tcp-wrappers version 7.6 (`tcp_wrappers_7.6.tar.gz`) was replaced with a trojaned version on several FTP distribution sites, including the primary site at the time (Eindhoven University). The backdoor provided root access to attackers initiating connections from source port 421 and also sent system information via email upon compilation.
