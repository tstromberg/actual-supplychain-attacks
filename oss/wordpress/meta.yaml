  title: WordPress official download backdoored enabling remote execution (2.1.1)
  synopsis: Shortly after its release, the official WordPress 2.1.1 download package (`.zip`) hosted on wordpress.org was compromised by attackers who gained access to a web server. Obfuscated malicious PHP code was injected into core files (`wp-includes/vars.php` and possibly `wp-includes/theme.php`), creating a backdoor. This backdoor allowed remote attackers to pass arbitrary PHP code via specific request parameters (like `ix` or `iz`) for execution on the server, effectively granting them control over sites that installed the compromised package. The WordPress team detected the compromise quickly, removed the malicious package, and released version 2.1.2 with fixes and additional security hardening.
