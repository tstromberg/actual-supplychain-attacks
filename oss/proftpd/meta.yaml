  title: ProFTPD official site compromise distributes backdoored source
  repo: https://github.com/proftpd/proftpd
  synopsis: The main FTP server distributing the ProFTPD source code (`ftp.proftpd.org`) was compromised. Attackers replaced the legitimate source code tarball for ProFTPD version 1.3.3c with a modified version containing a backdoor. Compiling and running this version would allow attackers remote root access.
