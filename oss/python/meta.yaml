  title: Python official Docker images include cryptominer malware
  repo: https://github.com/docker-library/python
  synopsis: Several official Python Docker image tags (including 3.9.7 and 3.10.0rc2 builds based on Debian Bullseye) hosted on Docker Hub were found to contain cryptomining malware (`libff.so`). The malicious code was unintentionally introduced into the images during the build/testing process on the build infrastructure, likely via a compromised third-party `.deb` package dependency. Affected images were quickly removed and replaced by the Docker security team and Python maintainers.
