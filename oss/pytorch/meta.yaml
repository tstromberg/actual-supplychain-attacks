  title: PyTorch nightly builds compromised via malicious dependency
  repo: https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch
  synopsis: PyTorch nightly builds were compromised when a malicious package named `torchtriton` was uploaded to PyPI. The PyTorch build process imported this package due to dependency confusion. The malicious `torchtriton` exfiltrated sensitive information from the build environment and executed code.
